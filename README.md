# OGA Minimal
A minimalist theme for EmulationStation on the Odroid Go Advance. Built on the back of lilbud's amazing [Minimal Theme for RetroPie](https://github.com/lilbud/es-theme-minimal).

## Guide

### Install
1. Add the Minimal folder to `/home/odroid/.emulationstation/themes`.
2. Restart EmulationStation.
3. In the main menu select UI Settings -> Theme Set -> Minimal.
4. Adjust your Gamelist View Style to Basic, Detailed, or Video.
5. Choose Back and then close the menu.

*For the best experience, set Carousel Transitions to OFF.*

### Change Background

1. Rename your desired image to `bg.png`.
2. Add the new image to the `assets` directory and replace the existing image.

*A few optional backgrounds are included in the `_extra` folder.*

## Obligatory Disclaimer

This theme is still under development. It is only being tested on the Odroid Go Advance hardware using @Valadaa42's excellent [RetroRoller Image](https://github.com/valadaa48/retroroller). I assume zero liability for whatever you do to your device. Use this theme at your own risk!
